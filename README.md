# TF2-JI-Reversed
Various reversed code from TF2's Jungle Inferno update

The provided code not intended to be compileable. It simply exists to give developers a glimpse at the behaviors of things added during Jungle Inferno. I only intend to reverse serverside code, any included client-sided code (mainly netvars) are a crapshoot.

Code is currently based on the December 16, 2020 Patch.
